# Seven Databases in Seven Weeks

I may not make it through in 7 weeks exactly, but that's not important.

Also, I do not feel any compunction to work through the book in chapter
order. I'm probably going to start with Postgres, with the following
chapter being the last on Redis. These are two we use where I'm
currently employed, so it just makes sense.

The book is too far out of date. Of the chapters so far on Redis,
CouchDB, and Riak, only the Redis chapter works as-is. Riak is dead, and
the CouchDB examples just don't work out of the box for me. Moving on
for now. I may finish the Redis chapter later.
